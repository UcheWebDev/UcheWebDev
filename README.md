A web software developer with an extra superpowerâ€” creating mobile & desktop apps.

Whether I'm writing vue js or fiddling with shell/bash , docker containers ,configuring virtual machines, provisioning cloud infastructures , building solid laravel services or solving algorithms in node js & python, my main objective is always the same, which is to create clean ,  modular & understandable codes that solves problems.

When not coding or sleeping, I'm most likely watching a movie or documentary, playing fifa or simply wondering if there's a slight chance the earth is flat.
